# Adaora's Fashion Website â€“ Worst UI Demo

This project is a demonstration of **bad UI practices**, created as part of a class assignment to design the worst user interface imaginable. The site features 8 interactive elements that intentionally break modern UI/UX standards.  

This project is also themed as **Adaora's Fashion Website** with a focus on pink aesthetics (but in a poorly implemented way).  

## **Live Demo**
The live site is hosted on [Vercel](#) (add your live Vercel link here).

## **Why This UI is Terrible**

### 1. **Full-Screen Modal**
- Appears on page load and blocks interaction until closed.  
- **Why it's bad:** Interrupts the user immediately without providing useful information.  

### 2. **Auto-Playing Music**
- Music starts automatically and loops endlessly.  
- **Why it's bad:** Distracting and provides no option to pause.  

### 3. **Hidden Navigation Menu**
- Navigation is hidden behind a small button with no labels.  
- **Why it's bad:** Makes navigation unintuitive and hard to find.  

### 4. **Unclear Links**
- Text links like "Click here" with no context.  
- **Why it's bad:** Users cannot predict where the link will take them.  

### 5. **Pop-Up Alerts**
- Multiple alerts appear, disrupting the browsing experience.  
- **Why it's bad:** Forces users to click through pop-ups to continue.  

### 6. **Poor Color Contrast**
- Bright yellow text on a white background.  
- **Why it's bad:** Strains the eyes and makes text difficult to read.  

### 7. **Unresponsive Design**
- Fixed-width layout that breaks on smaller screens.  
- **Why it's bad:** Provides a poor experience for mobile users.  

### 8. **Buttons That Do Nothing**
- Buttons that do not perform any action.  
- **Why it's bad:** Frustrates users expecting functionality.
